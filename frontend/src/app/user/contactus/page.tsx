        Toyota’s GR Corolla has been one of the most welcome additions to the US
        automotive market, especially since we can’t get the even crazier GR
        Yaris. The hot hatches are still around and frankly better than ever
        with manufacturers like Hyundai tapping into a sector they were
        previously absent from. Back on the JDM front though, Toyota will debut
        an enhanced version of their beloved GR Corolla for the 2025 model year
        with plenty of fun enhancement to make the driving experience even
        peppier.
